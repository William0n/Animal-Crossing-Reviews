## Data Preprocessing
The data set contained over 2000 different reviews that weren't exactly the cleanest, as such, the following changes were applied to the data:
  - Reviewer's usernames and dates removed
  - Changed `grade` variable to only include 2 types of reviews (i.e. the review is 1 for positive reviews and 0 for negative reviews)
  - Removed any unnecessary expressions and symbols from reviews
  - Padding added for any reviews less 400 characters
